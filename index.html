<p>I am an experienced front-end developer who enjoys building modern UI using the latest in web technologies. I frequently leverage the React and Redux ecosystems. Capable of continuous learning from more experienced colleagues while trying to pass on my knowledge to less skilled ones. Experience in driving projects forward, facilitating projects from concept to launch. Passionate about learning and development with a desire to apply skills on a team.</p>
